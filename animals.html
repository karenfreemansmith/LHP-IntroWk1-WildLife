      <h1>Our Backyard Wildlife</h1>
      <h2>My Boyfriend's quasi-pets</h2>
      <p>My boyfriend thinks dogs and cats are <em>too much responsibility</em>, but he sure takes good care of the wildlife in his backyard.</p>
      <p>He's always talking about:</p>
      <img src="img/squirrels.png" alt="picture of squirrels from Wikipedia">
      <ul>
        <li>the squirrels, at least 4 of them, including:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>the fat king of the roost</li>
          <li>the fat rival</li>
          <li>the little one</li>
        </ol>
        <li>the blue jays</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Favorite Foods</h3>
      <p>The wildlife, <em>especially the squirrels</em>, have my boyfriend well-trained to feed them. Whenever the dish is empty they will stare in the windows until he refills it. After careful observation, he has learned the <strong>squirrels favorite foods</strong>:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>salted peanuts...<em>they lick the salt off before burying the peanuts.</em></li>
        <li>sunflower seeds...<em>eaten immediately, but only if the peanuts have run out.</em></li>
        <li>other trail mix items like corn, but these are frequently left for the birds.</li>
        <li>fresh fruit...<em>only in times of desperation and under cover of darkness...possibly by a yet to be discovered type of backyard pet.</em></li>
      </ol>

      <p>The wildlife that finds its way into my truck isn't nearly as cute as the wildlife in my boyfriend's backyard.</p>
