        <h2>My Boyfriend's quasi-pets</h2>
        <p>My boyfriend thinks dogs and cats are <em>too much responsibility</em>, but he sure takes good care of the wildlife in his backyard.</p>

            <li>the squirrels, at least 4 of them, including:</li>
            <ol>
              <li>the fat king of the roost</li>
              <li>the fat rival</li>
              <li>the little one</li>

          <h3>Favorite Foods</h3>
          <p>The wildlife, <em>especially the squirrels</em>, have my boyfriend well-trained to feed them. Whenever the dish is empty they will stare in the windows until he refills it. After careful observation, he has learned the <strong>squirrels favorite foods</strong>:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>salted peanuts...<em>they lick the salt off before burying the peanuts.</em></li>
            <li>sunflower seeds...<em>eaten immediately, but only if the peanuts have run out.</em></li>
            <li>other trail mix items like corn, but these are frequently left for the birds.</li>
            <li>fresh fruit...<em>only in times of desperation and under cover of darkness...possibly by a yet to be discovered type of backyard pet.</em></li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Dead Animals?</h3>
          <p>Not all the wildlife we found in the backyard was alive... these deer were hidden under the blackberriesa as well!</p>

          <h3>My Own Wildlife</h3>
          <img src="img/bee.jpg" alt="photo of bee that got trapped in my truck" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail">
          <p>The wildlife that finds its way into my truck isn't nearly as cute as the wildlife in my boyfriend's backyard.</p>
