        <h2>The Money Pit</h2>
        <p>The house sat empty for about 7 years before my boyfriend bought it.  It is constantly under construction as he tears up the walls to fix the wiring.  It needs a new roof and new carpet (especially where the roof leaked!). </p>

            <p>One of the big projects we have for this summer is to fix the hole in the roof. (<em>You can help by mousing over the image of the ceiling!</em>) So far Chris has removed the drywall you see in this photo. And when he did? Well there were TONS of ants... living? dead? eggs? Poor man was just COVERED with ants of all kinds!</p>

            <p>The backyard is showing the most progress. Chris spend all of last summer pulling up blackberry vines and removing trash. You can see how the backyard is developing by holding your moust over the photo to your right. :)</p>

          <p>Each new project unearths archeological finds like mummified mice, old newspapers, children's toys, and scary wallpaper from the 60s.</p>
          <p>If you'd like to experience a little psycedelic trip to the past, indulge in the relaxant of your choice and hold your mouse over the wallpaper photos.</p>
