     <h1>Backyard Wildlife</h1>
     <h2>My Boyfriend's quasi-pets</h2>
     <p>My boyfriend thinks dogs and cats are too much responsibility, but he sure takes good care of the wildlife in his backyard.</p>
     <p>He's always talking about:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>the squirrels, at least 4 of them, including:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>the fat one</li>
          <li>the little one</li>
        </ol>
       <li>the blue jays</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>Favorite Foods</h3>
     <p>The wildlife, especially the squirrels, have my boyfriend well-trained to feed them. Whenever the dish is empty they will stare in the windows until he refills it. After careful observation, he has learned the squirrels favorite foods:</p>
     <ol>
       <li>salted peanuts...they lick the salt off before burying the peanuts.</li>
       <li>sunflower seeds...eaten immediately, but only if the peanuts have run out.</li>
       <li>other trail mix items like corn, but these are frequently left for the birds.</li>
       <li>fresh fruit...only in times of desperation and under cover of darkness...possibly by a yet to be discovered type of backyard pet.</li>
     </ol>
