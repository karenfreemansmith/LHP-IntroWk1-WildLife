     <h1>Backyard Wildlife</h1>
     <h2>My Boyfriend's quasi-pets</h2>
     <p>My boyfriend thinks dogs and cats are <em>too much responsibility</em>, but he sure takes good care of the wildlife in his backyard.</p>
     <p>He's always talking about:</p>

     <ul>
       <li>the squirrels, at least 4 of them, including:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>the fat king of the roost</li>
          <li>the fat rival</li>
          <li>the little one</li>
        </ol>
       <li>the blue jays</li>
     </ul>

     <h3>Favorite Foods</h3>
     <p>The wildlife, <em>especially the squirrels</em>, have my boyfriend well-trained to feed them. Whenever the dish is empty they will stare in the windows until he refills it. After careful observation, he has learned the <strong>squirrels favorite foods</strong>:</p>
     <ol>
       <li>salted peanuts...<em>they lick the salt off before burying the peanuts.</em></li>
       <li>sunflower seeds...<em>eaten immediately, but only if the peanuts have run out.</em></li>
       <li>other trail mix items like corn, but these are frequently left for the birds.</li>
       <li>fresh fruit...<em>only in times of desperation and under cover of darkness...possibly by a yet to be discovered type of backyard pet.</em></li>
     </ol>

    <p>The wildlife that finds its way into my truck isn't nearly as cute as the wildlife in my boyfriend's backyard.</p>
